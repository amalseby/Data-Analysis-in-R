LendingClub specializes in providing loans to urban clients and evaluates loan applications based on the applicant's profile. 
The company faces two types of risks: the potential loss of business if a loan to a creditworthy applicant is rejected, 
and the risk of financial loss if a loan is approved and the applicant defaults. The company analyzes data on past
applicants and their repayment behavior to identify patterns that indicate likelihood of loan failure. 
This information is used to make decisions like loan rejection, adjusting loan amounts, or lending to riskier applicants at higher interest rates.
Loan outcomes can result in full payment or being charged-off due to non-payment. The main financial risk for the 
company arises from lending to risky candidates, as defaulting borrowers lead to credit losses. 
The objective of the case study is to use machine learning to identify such high-risk candidates and determine the key variables that 
predict loan default, ultimately aiding the company in managing its portfolio and risk assessment.

Tasks:

5) 4. Decision Tree Model
  
6) Clustering

Conclusion
We utilised the Lending Club dataset to fit a predictive classifier that can predict whether an application would
pay back the loan in full or default based on their profile. We can predict 70% of the correct outcomes using
our approach. Although not perfect, this is a good start to forecasting, and perhaps in the future we will be
able to enhance our model with a better algorithm and higher data quality.
